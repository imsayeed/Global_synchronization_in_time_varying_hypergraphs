# Global_synchronization_in_time_varying_hypergraphs


This repository is part of the manuscript "Global synchronization on time-varying higher-order structures."


We hope the scripts and data included here will facilitate others in reproducing our results.
The repository includes  code for simulating coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators and Lorenz oscillators in the presence of time-varying higher-order interactions and code for simulating the stability of the synchronization state.

All scripts below can be run independently of each other.

1. The folder named "Stuart_landau" contains the codes for time series simulation of the coupled SL system and the code for simulating the stability condition of corresponding synchronous states for three different instances: diffusive regular topology, non-invasive coupling, and diffusive natural couplings. All these codes are written in C, and the code for plotting the results is available in Matlab scripts.
2. The folder named "Lorenz_system" contains the codes for the time series simulation of the coupled Lorenz system and the code for simulating the stability condition of the corresponding synchronous state.
3. The folder named "hypergraph_animation" contains the code for visualizing the time-varying hypergraph.
