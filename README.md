# Global_synchronization_in_time_varying_hypergraphs
This repository is part of the manuscript, "Global synchronization on time-varying higher-order structures".
We hope the scripts and data included here will facilitate others in reproducing our results.
The repository includes  code for simulating coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators and Lorenz oscillators in the presence of time-varying higher-order interactions, and code for simulating the stability of synchronizatio state
